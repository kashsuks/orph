# orph

This is orph. A doll version of orpheus that spins a sword. Theres some dark lore behind to why only half his body exists.
Essentially, she got into a car crash and lost half his body. She is now seeking revenge in order to see who did this to her, hence the sword.

TL;DR Orph is a replica of Hack Club's mascot, Orpheus that spins a carboard sword using a servo.

There is a video demo made by us! ![Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-YVZJ4Rpic)
